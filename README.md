<p>ScreenAvg Function is a function I often use when using the tkinter library. I wanted to share it with you. The purpose of the function is simple. To bring the interface to the center of the screen, we call the function and enter the required values. You can do this either in a "settings menu" in your interface when you want the user to set the interface size, or you can decide it yourself at the first start of the program. </p>
